* Parsing all iCalendar files should be working, please file a bug if 
  you can't read one!
* Timezones can be set for datetimes, but currently they'll be converted 
  to UTC for serializing, because VTIMEZONE serialization isn't yet 
  working.
* RRULEs can be parsed, but when they're serialized, they'll be 
  converted to a maximum of 500 RDATEs, because RRULE serialization 
  isn't yet working.
* To parse unicode, see issue 4.
* Much more testing is needed, of course!
